I enjoy development of low frequency quantitative investment strategies and have over 1.5 years' of experience in quantitative research and portfolio management working on systematic strategies and thematic portfolios at [Windmill Capital](https://windmillcapital.smallcase.com/). Previously, I have over 3 years' experience in credit research and risk management at Axis Bank. I have done my Bachelor of technology in Computational Biology and Master of Technology in Industrial Engineering from IIT Kanpur. I have also cleared CFA level II examination from CFA Institute(US). I enjoy understanding the nuances of capital markets leveraging alternative data, data science, and machine learning techniques.

## Project Portfolio

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for understanding the nuances of capital markets leveraging alternative data, data science and machine learning techniques.

## Stand-alone projects.

### Analysis of Active Portfolio Management
Exploration of sharpe ratio, information ratio, identification of closet index funds advertising itself as actively managed and visualization of active return in terms of asset allocation return, security selection return and security-asset selection allocation interaction return.  The code can be found [here](https://github.com/mnsh16/Finance/blob/master/Analysis%20of%20Active%20Portfolio%20Management.ipynb).

### Estimation of stock beta
Estimating betas by regressing stock returns (Rj) against market returns (Rm) and understanding of idiosyncratic risk. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/mnsh16/Finance/blob/master/Estimation%20of%20Stock%20Beta.ipynb).

### Weight allocation through Sharpe Ratio and Minimum Volatility Optimization
Smart weight allocation in portfolio through the means of Sharpe Ratio and Minimum Volatility optimization. Investment universe explored in this exercise consists of following instruments: JUNIORBEES, NIFTYBEES, GOLDBEES and RRSLGETF. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/mnsh16/Finance/blob/master/Maximum%20Sharpe%20Ratio_23FEB2019.ipynb).




Karl Broman is Professor in the
[Department of Biostatistics &amp; Medical Informatics](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu)
at the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison;
research in statistical genetics; developer of
[R/qtl](https://rqtl.org) (for [R](https://www.r-project.org)).

Karl received a BS in [mathematics](https://uwm.edu/math)
in 1991, from the
University of Wisconsin&ndash;Milwaukee, and a
PhD in [statistics](https://statistics.berkeley.edu) in 1997, from the
University of California, Berkeley; his PhD advisor was
[Terry Speed](https://www.wehi.edu.au/people/terry-speed).
He was a postdoctoral fellow with James Weber at the
[Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation](https://www.marshfieldresearch.org),
1997&ndash;1999. He
was a faculty member in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at Johns
Hopkins University, 1999&ndash;2007. In 2007, he moved to the
[University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison](https://www.wisc.edu).

Karl is a Senior Editor for [_Genetics_](https://www.genetics.org) and
a member of the [_BMC Biology_](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com)
[Editorial Board](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board).

Karl is an applied statistician focusing on problems in genetics and
genomics &ndash; particularly the analysis of meiotic recombination and the
genetic dissection of complex traits in experimental organisms. The
latter is often called &ldquo;QTL mapping.&rdquo; A QTL is a
_quantitative trait locus_ &ndash; a genetic locus that influences a
quantitative trait. He is enthusiastic about the value
of interactive data visualizations for exploring high-dimensional genetic data;
see his [R/qtlcharts package](https://kbroman.org/qtlcharts/) and
his [D3 examples](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/D3).
